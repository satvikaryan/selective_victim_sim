# Selective Victim Caching Implementation

This repository contains an implementation of Selective Victim Caching in Python.

## Description

The provided code implements a cache system using Selective Victim Caching strategy. It consists of a `Cache` class with methods for reading, writing, evicting, accessing, and printing cache state. The implementation aims to optimize cache performance by selectively evicting cache blocks based on hit and sticky bits.

## Current Status

However, the current implementation is not giving the expected results. There are issues with the cache access logic, which result in incorrect cache states after certain operations.

## Future Work

This project is still a work in progress. Future updates and improvements will include debugging the existing code to resolve issues and ensuring correct functionality of the cache system. Additionally, further optimizations and enhancements may be implemented to improve overall performance and reliability.
The code itself is by no means complete and was being written because the simulator by University of Massachusetts is not accessible
